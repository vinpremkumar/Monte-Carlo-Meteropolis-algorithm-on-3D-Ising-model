Ising Model and Metropolis Algorithm by the  MathWorks Physics Team is an excellent code for simulating 2D Ising model using Monte-Carlo Meteropolis algorithm. However, the modelling of the 3D Ising model was left as an *Exercise (no. 9)*. In this repository, I have coded the 3D Ising model, as well as visualized it.

Run **_runthis_containsvariablesfortuning.m_** file for most of the basic tuning of Monte-Carlo metropolis algorithm on 3D Ising model.
For more advanced tuning, edit **_MCmetropolis_on_3DIsing.m_** file.
