# Monte-Carlo-Meteropolis-algorithm-on-3D-Ising-model
Ising Model and Metropolis Algorithm by the  MathWorks Physics Team is an excellent code for simulating 2D Ising model using Monte-Carlo Meteropolis algorithm. However, the modelling of the 3D Ising model was left as an Exercise (no. 9). In this repository, I have coded the 3D Ising model, as well as visualized it.
